Airtern Git Funtime
========

Git is core to nearly every company in tech right now. You cannot go wrong learning more about git, and we would like as little friction to your bootup experience at Airbnb as possible. In fact, ideally, you should be committing code that goes live on your first day here.

And so, it is Git(hub) exercise time! If you're unfamiliar with Git, here's a place to start: https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-other-good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github

Please clone the repo and create a directory in the root named like your name in camel_case (so my directory would be `alex_davis`). It should have at least one file: an `about.txt` with a quick, public description of you that gives us a little bit of insight into who you are! Then pull request it; I will merge it in (and maybe even provide comments).

Totally optoinal: Bonus points if you later commit a [Codecademy Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) screenshot that looks like [this](http://screencast.com/t/tLl1V2ClW). If you have never taken them, the codecademy guildes are great but very basic, so you should be able to breeze right through it even if you have never encountered Ruby before. Plus, its pretty fun.

Pull request it, and I will merge it in! Example: https://github.com/lxdvs/airterns/pull/1
