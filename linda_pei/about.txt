Hi everyone! My name is Linda Pei, and I’m a rising senior at Cornell University.
I am from New York City, but was originally born in Tianjin, China. I’ll be working
on the Payments team this summer. In my spare time, I like to bike and explore the
area! I also love skiing every weekend in the winter time.
